\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Implement the base Figure Figure with the abstract Draw () method. Create the Square and Rectangle classes (depicted in Figure) in which the implementation of the Draw () method is overloaded displays the name of the class in which this method is implemented. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Using the previous task, add X and Y to the Figure readonly class. Also, in the Figure class, add a parameterized constructor that sets values in these dummies. Fix the named classes so that they work correctly by calling the base designer. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_test_project_1_1_task_library_1_1_tasks_1_1_lesson3_1_1_task3}{Task3}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Using the previous task, change the abstract Draw () method to the virtual one and implement it in the same way as in the Square and Rectangle classes. Make sure that the object of the Figure class can now be initialized and calls to the Draw () method on the objects of the created classes will lead to the call of three different implementations. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_test_project_1_1_task_library_1_1_tasks_1_1_lesson3_1_1_task4}{Task4}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Using the previous task, draw the Draw () method to the I\+Drawable interface. Create a Draw\+All (params I\+Drawable \mbox{[}\mbox{]} array method to convey the objects of the created classes and call the Draw () method for each of them in a loop. Make sure that the correct implementation of the Draw () method is caused for each of the classes. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
